For example, when observing problems, they may watch workers assembling parts in a factory or staff carrying out their tasks in a hospital. When solving problems, they may be in an office at a computer looking at data that they or others have collected.Industrial engineers need a bachelor's degree, typically in industrial engineering. However, many industrial engineers have degrees in mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, industrial engineering technology, or general engineering.The median annual wage for industrial engineers was $78,860 in May 2012.Employment of industrial engineers is projected to grow 5 percent from 2012 to 2022, slower than the average for all occupations. This occupation is versatile both in the kind of work it does and in the industries in which its expertise can be put to use.
