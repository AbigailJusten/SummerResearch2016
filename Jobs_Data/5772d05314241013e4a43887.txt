Description: Investigate and describe the determinants and distribution of disease, disability, or health outcomes. May develop the means for prevention and control.

For example, surgeons must complete four years of college and an additional five to seven years of specialized medical training to be able to do their job.

Significant Points: Epidemiologists are public health professionals who investigate patterns and causes of disease and injury in humans. They seek to reduce the risk and occurrence of negative health outcomes through research, community education, and health policy.Epidemiologists work in offices and laboratories, usually at health departments for state and local governments, in hospitals, and at colleges and universities. Some do fieldwork to conduct interviews and collect samples for analyses. Fieldwork may bring epidemiologists into contact with infectious disease, but they very rarely get sick or suffer contagion.Epidemiologists need at least a master's degree from an accredited postsecondary institution. Most epidemiologists have a master's in public health (MPH) or a related field, and some have a doctoral training in epidemiology.The median annual wage for epidemiologists was $65,270 in May 2012.Employment of epidemiologists is projected to grow 10 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Epidemiologists are likely to have good job prospects overall.
