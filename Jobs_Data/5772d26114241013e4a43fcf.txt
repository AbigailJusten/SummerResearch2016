Workers spend all their time outdoors, sometimes in poor weather and often in isolated areas.Most logging workers have a high school diploma. They get on-the-job training to become familiar with forest environments and to learn how to operate logging machinery.The median annual wage for logging workers was $33,630 in May 2012.Employment of logging workers is projected to decline 9 percent from 2012 to 2022.
