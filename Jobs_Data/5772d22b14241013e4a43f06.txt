Job Title: Semiconductor Processors
Major:  Metal Work & Precision Production

Description: Perform any or all of the following functions in the manufacture of electronic semiconductors: load semiconductor material into furnace; saw formed ingots into segments; load individual segment into crystal growing chamber and monitor controls; locate crystal axis in ingot using x-ray equipment and saw ingots into wafers; and clean, polish, and load wafers into series of special purpose furnaces, chemical baths, and equipment used to form circuitry and change conductive properties.

Requirements: Experience: Some previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience may be helpful in these occupations, but usually is not needed. For example, a drywall installer might benefit from experience installing drywall, but an inexperienced person could still learn to be an installer with little difficulty.

Education: These occupations usually require a high school diploma and may require some vocational training or job-related course work. In some cases, an associate's or bachelor's degree could be needed.

Training: Employees in these occupations need anywhere from a few months to one year of working with experienced employees.


Significant Points: Semiconductor processors oversee the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, which are commonly known as integrated circuits or microchips. These microchips are found in all electronic devices—including cell phones, cars, and laptops—and are an important part of modern life.Microchips must be kept completely clean and free of impurities because the circuitry is so small that a particle of dust can damage it. To ensure this, semiconductor processors work in âclean roomsâ that are kept free of contamination. They wear special garments, called âbunny suits,â over their clothes to prevent lint or other particles from contaminating the clean room.Many employers prefer that semiconductor processors have an associate's degree in a field such as microelectronics.The median annual wage for semiconductor processors was $33,020 in May 2012.Employment of semiconductor processors is projected to decline 27 percent from 2012 to 2022. Although there will be a strong demand for semiconductors in many products, automation at semiconductor factories, known as fabricating plants, is expected to grow, so fewer workers will be needed in this occupation.
