The need to meet deadlines and respond to emergencies often requires long hours.Large construction firms increasingly prefer candidates with both construction experience and a bachelor's degree in a construction-related field. However, some managers may qualify with a high school diploma and by working many years in a construction trade, although most will qualify primarily as self-employed general contractors.The median annual wage for construction managers was $82,790 in May 2012.Employment of construction managers is projected to grow 16 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for all occupations.

Those with a bachelor's degree in construction science, construction management, or civil engineering, coupled with construction experience, will have the best job prospects.
