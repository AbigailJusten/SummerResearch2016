Job Title: Marine Geology/Geographical Oceanography

Information: Consider earning a masterâ€™s degree to be more competitive for education and laboratory/field research positions.Pursue extensive laboratory and research experience by working in faculty laboratories through independent research classes, as a student employee, or through other departmental programs.Field work experience is also very important.Seek internships, summer jobs, or volunteer positions to gain experience. Some professionals in the field will begin their careers in temporary jobs.Supplement curriculum with additional courses in relevant areas, e.g., environmental studies, GIS, remote sensing, biology, and physics to complement geology coursework.For geologic engineering careers, consider an additional major or minor in physics, geophysics and/or engineering; knowledge of engineering is essential.Learn to set up, operate, and maintain laboratory instruments and equipment, and monitor samples.Develop public speaking skills through coursework or experience. Practice good communication and problem solving skills.Exercise close attention to detail.Seek experience with data management, analysis, and statistical tools used in research. Gain experience with computer modeling and Global Positioning System (GPS). Both are used to locate geological deposits.Gain a thorough understanding of federal and state government guidelines for the management of solid, liquid, and gaseous waste. Investigate certification programs for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard (HAZWOPER).Prepare to work with teams of scientists and other staff in the field for extended periods.Many geologists who work in the oil and gas industry may work in the geographic areas where deposits are found including offshore sites and in overseas oil-producing countries. This industry is subject to fluctuations, so be prepared to work on a contract basis.In mineralogy, consider specializing in a particular mineral or metal to build an area of expertise. Seek opportunities to develop strong technical skills, as mining geologists rely heavily on computerized models to learn about mineral deposits.Become familiar with government job application procedures and use your college career center.Maintain an excellent GPA, particularly in the sciences, and build relationships with faculty. Strong recommendations from professors are needed for graduate and professional schools.Join professional associations (e.g. Geological Society of America, Geophysical Union) and environmental groups as way to learn about the field and network.To work in publishing fields, take advanced courses in technical writing or journalism classes or consider a minor in either. Research an advanced degree in a communications field to specialize, e.g., scientific journalism or public relations.
